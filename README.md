# iotobex-client-example-stomp-python

Example of client implementation demonstrating a method of connection to the Iotobex service, in this case aSTOMP connection utilizing Python.

Iotobex is an information exchange for the Internet of Things. It enables:

The dissemination of, and easy access to, “public” Internet of Things (IoT) information.
The sharing of IoT-derived “private” information between associated providers and subscribers, as authorised.
OpenWire is a binary protocol designed for working with message-oriented middleware, and is the native wire format of the Iotobex message broker (ActiveMQ). It an ideal choice for communication with so-called native clients usually written in Java, C, or C#. As the native wire protocol, it will generally offer the best performance. However the inherent efficiency and performance of the OpenWire protocol comes at a cost, being the complexity of implementation on the client side.

You will need an Iotobex user account. Be sure to configure the credentials and access URI in ClientExampleOpenWire.java as per the Credentials and OpenWire specifics as provided through the Iotobex Client Console. In addition, the stream name utilized in the example below must be configured for the user whose credentials are specified. By means of the Iotobex Client Console, configure the stream name as both a publishable and subscribed stream.
